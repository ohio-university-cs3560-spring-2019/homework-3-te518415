The standard deviation of set of elements is the
average difference between every element of a set.

If we are given the mean of a set, we can calculate the
standard deviation by subtracting the mean from every element
squaring the result, adding every element, diving by the number
of elements and then taking the square root of the final element.



$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(x + \overline{x})^2}{n}}$
